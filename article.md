Blockchain is a globally shared, transactional database.
•	Uses a shared distributed ledger
o	Everyone can read entries and transactions in the database just by participating in the network
•	Leverages consensus Mechanism for Validating the transactions.
o	If something is gonna be changed in the database, the so-called transaction must be validated by all others 
•	Transactions are immutable, cause of the Block & Chain Structure
•	While a transaction is being applied to the database, no other transaction can alter it. ( It is not gonna be done at all or completely applied if the two values wanted to be changed at the same time.
•	Uses cryptography for trust, accountability, and security.
o	Transaction is always cryptographically signed by the sender. This method makes it straightforward to guard Access to specific modifications of the database.

BLOCKS & SECURITY
Order selection mechanism which is calling mining letting the transactions bundle into block and then they will be executed and distributed among all participating nodes. If two transactions contradict each other the one that en sup being second wll be rejected and not become part of the block.

Data added to the ledger cannt be updated or deleted,
Index is block number, Timestamp, Hash Value, Data
When change is made previous hash value will be strored at the current block.
